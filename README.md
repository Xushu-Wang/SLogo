# SLogo IDE



Welcome to the SLogo project! This Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is crafted for the Logo programming language, as part of Duke Universityâ€™s CS 308, focusing on Design and Implementation. Our team, composed of five developers, has worked meticulously to provide approximately 6300 lines of code that bring you an immersive turtle-based programming experience.









### Features

* Execute SLogo code across various languages.
* Animate turtle movements to visualize the execution.
* Run pre-written SLogo scripts to understand language constructs.
* Manage multiple workspaces with diverse functions.




### Running the Program

* Main class: Press the play button on the main class, then select a language when prompted!

* Data files needed:
   * Language properties files that are included in the Resources folder.
   * CSS file included in the resources folder is needed for styling.
   * Images included in the UI folders required.

* Interesting data files:
   * Slogo examples files!

* Key/Mouse inputs:
   * Enter Slogo commands into the input box. Click on the Run button to the right of the input box
     to run the desired command.
   * There are two windows to the left of the Canvas.
      * The top window has three tabs: Help, History, and Customize
         * Help lists all the documentation for Slogo.
         * History lists all previously run commands.
         * Customize tab will allow you to customize elements of the turtle and the canvas. (Note: Not fully functioning)
      * The bottom window has two tabs: Variables and Functions.
         * Each lists user-created variables and functions.
   * The buttons beside the title do the following on a mouse click:
      * Save: Save what is inside the input box to a .slogo file.
      * Load: Open a slogo file to put inside the input box
      * About: View a window of information about who created the program!
      * Clear: Clear all trails and reset the turtles back to their initial position
      * New Window: Open a new Slogo window.



### Notes

* Features implemented:
  * All basic SLogo commands
  * Animation for turtle movement across canvas
  * SLogo file upload and download
  * Visualization of workspace information (variables and functions) and command history
  * Display of additional information on available commands
  * Support for different languages
  * Possibility of running unlimited IDE windows simultaneously

* Features unimplemented:
  * View customization (colors and turtles)
  * Run commands directly from history
  * User-defined movement speed for turtle(s)

* Noteworthy Features:
  * Successfully implemented / displayed user-defined commands and variables
  * User-friendly error catching
  * Display of unlimited independent windows
