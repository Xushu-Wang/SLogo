# SLogo IDE



Welcome to the SLogo project! This Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is crafted for the Logo programming language, as part of Duke Universityâ€™s CS 308, focusing on Design and Implementation. Our team, composed of four developers, has worked meticulously to provide approximately 6300 lines of code that bring you an immersive turtle-based programming experience.
